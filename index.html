<li><details><summary>Abstract</summary>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, demonstrating capabilities that closely resemble those of humans. These AI models are playing an essential role in assisting humans with a wide array of tasks in daily life. A significant application of AI is its use as a chat agent, responding to human inquiries across various domains. Current LLMs have shown proficiency in answering general questions. However, basic question-answering dialogue often falls short in complex diagnostic scenarios, such as legal or medical consultations. These scenarios typically necessitate Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD), wherein an AI chat agent needs to proactively pose questions and guide users towards specific task completion. Previous fine-tuning models have underperformed in TOD, and current LLMs do not inherently possess this capability. In this paper, we introduce DiagGPT (Dialogue in Diagnosis GPT), an innovative method that extends LLMs to TOD scenarios. Our experiments reveal that DiagGPT exhibits outstanding performance in conducting TOD with users, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.</details></li>

<li><details><summary>Abstract</summary>Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning capabilities, particularly when guided by specifically designed prompts in complex reasoning tasks such as math word problems. These models typically solve tasks using a chain-of-thought approach, which not only bolsters their reasoning abilities but also provides valuable insights into their problem-solving process. However, there is still significant room for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Some studies suggest that the integration of an LLM output verifier can boost reasoning accuracy without necessitating additional model training. In this paper, we follow these studies and introduce a novel graph-based method to further augment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We posit that multiple solutions to a reasoning task, generated by an LLM, can be represented as a reasoning graph due to the logical connections between intermediate steps from different reasoning paths. Therefore, we propose the Reasoning Graph Verifier (RGV) to analyze and verify the solutions generated by LLMs. By evaluating these graphs, models can yield more accurate and reliable results.Our experimental results show that our graph-based verification method not only significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs but also outperforms existing verifier methods in terms of improving these models' reasoning performance.</details></li>

<p><strong>AutoAM: An End-To-End Neural Model for Automatic and Universal Argument Mining</strong></p>

<li><details><summary>Abstract</summary>Argument mining is to analyze argument structure and extract important argument information from unstructured text. An argument mining system can help people automatically gain causal and logical information behind the text. As argumentative corpus gradually increases, like more people begin to argue and debate on social media, argument mining from them is becoming increasingly critical. However, argument mining is still a big challenge in natural language tasks due to its difficulty, and relative techniques are not mature. For example, research on non-tree argument mining needs to be done more. Most works just focus on extracting tree structure argument information. Moreover, current methods cannot accurately describe and capture argument relations and do not predict their types. In this paper, we propose a novel neural model called AutoAM to solve these problems. We first introduce the argument component attention mechanism in our model. It can capture the relevant information between argument components, so our model can better perform argument mining. Our model is a universal end-to-end framework, which can analyze argument structure without constraints like tree structure and complete three subtasks of argument mining in one model. The experiment results show that our model outperforms the existing works on several metrics in two public datasets. We will release our code after paper publication.</details></li>

<p><strong>PILOT: Legal Case Outcome Prediction with Case Law</strong></p>

<li><details><summary>Abstract</summary>Machine learning shows promise in predicting the outcome of legal cases, but most research has concentrated on civil law cases rather than case law systems. We identified two unique challenges in making legal case outcome predictions with case law. First, it is crucial to identify relevant precedent cases that serve as fundamental evidence for judges during decision-making. Second, it is necessary to consider the evolution of legal principles over time, as early cases may adhere to different legal contexts.<br>In this paper, we proposed a new model named PILOT (PredictIng Legal case OuTcome) for case outcome prediction. It comprises two modules for relevant case retrieval and temporal pattern handling, respectively. To benchmark the performance of existing legal case outcome prediction models, we curated a dataset from a large-scale case law database. We demonstrate the importance of accurately identifying precedent cases and mitigating the temporal shift when making predictions for case law, as our method shows a significant improvement over the prior methods that focus on civil law case outcome predictions.</details></li>
